Your citizens seem happy enough at the parade, but you know they must be worried; you are here because of a letter you recieved from your chamberlain, saying something is terribly wrong! You wonder if you would be better off just heading back to your vacation.")

Inside, two men - wizards, as you can tell from their staffs and flowing black robes - are chatting loudly about how scared people were of the dragon illusion they conjured. You know they are the source of the trouble. You unsheathe your sword and charge in, slicing one in half before he can respond. The other tries to fire a spell at you, but you block it with your sword and get him as well. You lower your sword, panting. You have vanquished the evil, and a grin spreads across your face. It's time to head back to Eckberton. Maybe this time there'll be a feast...")
